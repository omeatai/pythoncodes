# You can use double or single quotes:
# a = "Hello"
# b = 'Hello'
# print(a)
# print(b)

#You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
# b = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
# consectetur adipiscing elit,
# sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
# ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
# print(b)

# Get the character at position 1 
# (remember that the first character has the position 0):
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a[1])

#Get the characters from position 2 to position 5:
# b = "Hello, Mike!"
# print(b[2:5])
#Get the characters from position StartIndex to position EndIndex (with step):
# b = "Hello Everyone"
# print(b[0:10])
# print(b[2:5])
# print(b[1:8:1])
# print(b[2:10:3])

# b = "Hello, Mike!"
# print(b[-5:-2])
# print(b[-8:-2:1])
# print(b[-10:-2:2])

#To get the length of a string(number of characters), use the “len()” function.
# a = "Hello, Mik"
# print(len(a))

#Check if the phrase "ain" is present or NOT present in the following text:
# txt = "The rain keeps falling during winter."
# x = "ain" in txt
# y = "ain" not in txt
# print(x) 
# print(y) 

#Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:
# a = "Hello"
# b = "Mike!"
# c = a + b
# d = a + " " + b
# print(c)
# print(d)
